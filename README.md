hello-world
===========

My first test repository


Fine. You asked for it, so now we're gonna put some *stuff* in here.

**Watch This**
:boom:

```java
public static void main(String args[])
{
  return "Hello";
}
```


Ok , we're gonna add a C++ function here
```c++
void sayHi()
{
  cout << "Hi\r\n";
}
```


This should appear if an edit from `Eclipse` has worked !!


Yay ! Good job, man ;)
